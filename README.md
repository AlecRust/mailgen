## Usage

First, install the package using npm:

```shell
npm install mailgen --save
```

Then, start using the package by importing and configuring it:

```js
var Mailgen = require('mailgen');

// Configure mailgen by setting a theme and your product info
var mailGenerator = new Mailgen({
    theme: 'default',
    product: {
        // Appears in header & footer of e-mails
        name: 'Mailgen',
        link: 'https://mailgen.js/'
        // Optional product logo
        // logo: 'https://mailgen.js/img/logo.png'
    }
});
```

Next, generate an e-mail using the following code:

```js
// Prepare email contents
var email = {
    body: {
        name: 'John Appleseed',
        intro: 'Welcome to Mailgen! Weâ€™re very excited to have you on board.',
        action: {
            instructions: 'To get started with Mailgen, please click here:',
            button: {
                color: 'green',
                text: 'Confirm Your Account',
                link: 'https://mailgen.js/confirm?s=d9729feb74992cc3482b350163a1a010'
            }
        },
        outro: 'Need help, or have questions? Just reply to this email, we\'d love to help.'
    }
};

// Generate an HTML email using mailgen
var emailBody = mailGenerator.generate(email);

// `emailBody` now contains the HTML body.
// It's up to you to send the e-mail. 
// Check out nodemailer to accomplish this: 
// https://nodemailer.com/
```

This code would output the following HTML template:

![Welcome](https://raw.github.com/eladnava/mailgen/master/screenshots/default/1.png)

## Plaintext E-mails

To generate a [plaintext version of the e-mail](https://litmus.com/blog/best-practices-for-plain-text-emails-a-look-at-why-theyre-important), simply call `generatePlaintext()`:

```js
// Generate plaintext email using mailgen
var emailText = mailGenerator.generatePlaintext(email);
```

## Supported Themes

The following open-source themes are bundled with this package:

* `default` - [Postmark Transactional Email Templates](https://github.com/wildbit/postmark-templates)

We thank the contributing authors for creating these themes.

## Custom Themes

We use [ejs](http://ejs.co/) under the hood to inject the e-mail body you provide into the theme.

If you want to create your own custom theme, it's a good idea to base off of the [`themes/default/index.txt`](https://github.com/eladnava/mailgen/blob/master/themes/default/index.txt) file, or at least copy the variable injection logic from it to your custom theme file.

When you've got your theme ready, provide the path to it as follows:

```js
var path = require('path');
var Mailgen = require('mailgen');

// Configure mailgen by providing the path to your custom theme
var mailGenerator = new Mailgen({
    theme: {
        // Build an absolute path to the theme file within your project
        path: path.resolve('assets/mailgen/theme.html'),
        // Also (optionally) provide the path to a plaintext version of the theme (if you wish to use `generatePlaintext()`)
        plaintextPath: path.resolve('assets/mailgen/theme.txt')
    },
    // Configure your product as usual (see examples above)
    product: {}
});
```

## Troubleshooting

1. After sending multiple e-mails to the same Gmail / Inbox address, they become grouped and truncated since they contain similar text, breaking the responsive e-mail layout.

> Simply sending the `X-Entity-Ref-ID` header with your e-mails will prevent grouping / truncation.
